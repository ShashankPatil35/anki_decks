###### Question number 1.

What is a blockchain?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the security, transparency, and immutability of the data.

</p>

###### Question number 2.

How does blockchain work?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

 Blockchain works by grouping transactions into blocks, which are linked together in a chronological chain. Each block contains a set of transactions and a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block.

</p>

###### Question number 3.

What's the role of cryptography in blockchain?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

 Cryptography is used to secure data in blockchain. It ensures that only authorized parties can access and validate the transactions. Public and private keys are used to sign and verify transactions.

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 4.

 What is decentralization in blockchain?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Decentralization means that there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the blockchain network. Instead, transactions are validated by a distributed network of nodes (computers) in a peer-to-peer fashion

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 5.

How are transactions added to a blockchain?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Transactions are added through a process called consensus. In proof-of-work blockchains, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and the first one to solve it gets to add a new block of transactions. In proof-of-stake blockchains, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake."

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 6.

What is a smart contract in blockchain?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

 A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 7.

How does blockchain ensure the security of transactions?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions. Each transaction is digitally signed, and the decentralized network verifies the signatures, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized changes to occur.

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 8.

What is the role of miners or validators in blockchain networks?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Miners (in PoW) and validators (in PoS) play a crucial role in validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain. They are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their work, which includes solving cryptographic puzzles (PoW) or staking and validating transactions (PoS).

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 9.

How does blockchain handle privacy and anonymity?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Blockchain offers varying levels of privacy. While transaction details are recorded on the public ledger, some blockchains, like Monero and Zcash, are designed to provide enhanced privacy and anonymity by using advanced cryptographic techniques.

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 10.

What are the energy concerns with proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Proof-of-work blockchains require substantial computational power, leading to high energy consumption. This has raised environmental concerns, as the energy usage for mining can be substantial.

</p>
</details>

<br><br>

###### Question number 11.

 What is the role of a consensus algorithm in blockchain security?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

 The consensus algorithm is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain. It determines how agreement is reached among network participants, making it difficult for any single entity to manipulate the data.
